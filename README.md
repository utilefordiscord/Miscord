## Why Miscord?
Miscord is a project by the [Utile Developers Team](https://github.com/orgs/utilefordiscord/teams/developers/members) for the **Discord Hack Week**, which lasted from June 24 to June 28, 2019.

It is a Discord bot made in Python which allows you to create songs using `discord.py`'s internal voice support and a custom implementation of the Github NoopsChallenge's Drumbot API, play songs from the internet, display the lyrics and information of the song (Genius) and more fun and entertaining things like a leveling system for your server.

## Get Started
Using **Miscord** is a really straight-forward process.

Invite Miscord from [this link](https://utileForDiscord.github,io/miscord/invite).<br>
Once done that, the owner of the server will receive a guide from Miscord that will show how to set up it for the server.

To get a full list of all the commands of Miscord, go [here](https://utileForDiscord.github.io/miscord/commands).
